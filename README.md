this is the hello world introductory repository for Blake Campshure
Hello world! i'm currently a Junior Mecanical Engineering Student at the Milwaukee School of Engineering.  I found out about 
github through research into raspberry pi projects.  I thought that they would be cool things to make and give as gifts. I 
look forward as much as i can through this website and look forward to using it as a resource for future projects.
